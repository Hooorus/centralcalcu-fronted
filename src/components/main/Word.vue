      The bar chart indicates the motivations of learning of students at different stages of life and the proportion of
      studying supported by managers in methods of time off and getting help of fees.
      <br>

      Overall, the factor for career was generally advantageous/governing in the most time of these students' life.
      Besides, the share of support from leaders was significant at the early period of professional life of staffs, and
      at the middle stage of the entire time, it was lowest.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the early period of under 26, the proportion of around 80% focused on studying for career, while only 10%
      studied
      for interest. In the following 22-29 and 30-39 age groups, the percentage of study aimed at career gradually
      reduced
      by approximately 10% and 13% yet interest-based study increased by 5% and 9%. It is a turning period for age
      groups
      of 40-49, when share of students studied for career or interest was balanced, both two presented just over 40% of
      the categories. The roles dramatically reversed at the period of over 49, the percentage of interest was 70%, with
      that of career was just under 20%.

      When it comes to employer support, the rate was highest at the period of under 26, which was nearly
      three-quarters.
      The figure was weakened to around 51% at the age points of 26 to 29. In the following 30-39 age groups, the
      portion
      further declined to more than a third. After that, the quantity tended to increase, at 40 to 49, the share was
      nearly two-fifths. And at the period of over 49, the rate hit to roughly 45%.
